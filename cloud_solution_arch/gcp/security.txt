## Compute Engine

Ex1: A company needs a solution to enforce data encryption at rest on GCP/AWS/AZ EC2/VM instances, must automatically identify noncompliant resources and 
enforce compliance policies on ndings. Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST administrative overhead?
#GCP
Sol: Enforce disk encryption by using GCP Organization Policy Service with the constraint compute.requireCmekForDiskCreation to automatically require encryption
for all Compute Engine disks, and use Cloud Asset Inventory to identify any existing noncompliant resources.
#AWS
Enable AWS Config with the managed rule encrypted-volumes to automatically identify EC2 instances with unencrypted EBS volumes, and configure automatic remediation 
using AWS Systems Manager Automation. This solution continuously enforces encryption at rest with minimal administrative overhead.
#AZ
Use Azure Policy with built-in policies to require Azure Disk Encryption for virtual machine OS and data disks and configure automatic remediation using
DeployIfNotExists.Azure Policy continuously identifies noncompliant VMs and enforces encryption at rest with the least administrative overhead.
