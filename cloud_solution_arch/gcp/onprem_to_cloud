## 
Ex1: A company wants to migrate its web applications from on premises to AWS. The company is located close to the eu-central-1 Region. Because of regulations,
the company cannot launch some of its applications in eu-central-1. The company wants to achieve single-digit millisecond latency.
#Azure
Sol: Deploy the web applications in a compliant Azure region and use Azure Edge Zones along with Azure Front Door to serve traffic close to users to achieve
single-digit millisecond latency while ensuring applications are not launched in the restricted region.
#GCP
Deploy the web applications in a compliant GCP region and front them with Google Cloud’s global external HTTP(S) Load Balancer and Cloud CDN provides single-digit 
millisecond latency through Google’s global edge network while ensuring applications are not launched in the restricted region.
#AWS
Deploy the web applications on Amazon EC2 instances in an AWS Local Zone located close to the company, while using a parent AWS Region other than eu-central-1. 
AWS Local Zones provide single-digit millisecond latency while allowing the company to meet regulatory requirements by avoiding deployment in eu-central-1.

Ex2: A company is migrating its multi-tier on-premises application to AWS. The application consists of a single-node MySQL database and a multi-node web tier. The
company must minimize changes to the application during the migration. The company wants to improve application resiliency after the migration.
#AWS
Sol: Migrate the MySQL database to Amazon RDS for MySQL with Multi-AZ enabled and deploy the web tier on EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group across 
multiple Availability Zones, fronted by an Application Load Balancer.This approach requires minimal application changes while significantly improving resiliency 
through managed database failover, load balancing, and automatic scaling.
 #GCP
Migrate the MySQL database to Cloud SQL for MySQL with high availability enabled, and deploy the web tier on Compute Engine instances in a managed instance group 
across multiple zones, fronted by a Google Cloud external HTTP(S) load balancer. This approach minimizes application changes while improving resiliency through
managed database failover, load balancing, and automatic instance healing.
#Azure
Migrate the MySQL database to Azure Database for MySQL – Flexible Server with zone-redundant high availability, and deploy the web tier on Virtual Machines in an 
Availability Set or VM Scale Set across multiple zones, fronted by an Azure Load Balancer or Application Gateway. This approach minimizes application changes while
improving resiliency through managed database failover, load balancing, and automatic scaling.
